# Tasks
* Manual option of going to rest between battles
* A view to show player stats
* Actual game over
* Initial screen to choose a character
* Setting some getter that says whether travelling is over?
* Actually, now that tick length is a global through the store, I should set some standard tick lengths for things that should stay longer, like initial and final ticks
