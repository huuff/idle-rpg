# Tasks
* Player should be in a pinia store
* It's likely that Scenes should control the duration of the initial tick (e.g. displaying the encounter in Battler) and of the end tick (e.g. displaying whether you won or lost). For the end tick, I could return it from the method. No idea for the initial tick unfortunately
